## How to Download and Run The Scripts
To download this repository, click on the green 'Clone or download' button near the top right of this page, and then select 'Download ZIP'. You will need to then unzip the downloaded file.
Python 3.7.4 was used to create the scripts in this repository (download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)), and any version of Python 3 can run the scripts.

## Files in this Repository
* a 'createDataFrame' file that creates a pandas dataframe based on the irisDataSet file
* a 'createHistograms' file that creates and saves histograms for each of the variables
* a 'createScatterPlots' file that creates and saves scatter plots for each pair of variables
* a 'createSummaries' file that creates and saves a summary of each variable
* an 'analysis' file which is the main application script and which imports and runs the functions in the other files
