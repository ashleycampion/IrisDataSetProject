# Housekeeping

## Python Files in this Repository
* an 'analysis' file which is the main application script and which imports and runs the functions in the other files
* a 'createBoxplots' file that saves boxplots overlayed with swarm plots to the plots\boxplots folder
* a 'createDataFrame' file that creates a pandas dataframe object based on the irisDataSet file
* a 'createHistograms' file that saves histograms for to the plots\histograms folder
* a 'createParallelCoordinates' file that saves a parallel coordinates plot to the plots\parallelCoordinates folder
* a 'createScatterPlots' file that saves scatter plots to the plots\scatterPlots folder
* a 'createSummaryStatistics' file that saves summary statistics for each species to a csv file in the summaryStatistics folder
* a 'verifyIntegrityOfDataset' file to do just that

## How to Download this Repository
Click on the green 'Clone or download' button near the top right of this page, and then select 'Download ZIP'. You will then need to unzip the downloaded file. You can download 7-zip [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

## What is Needed to Run the Python Scripts
Python 3.7.4 was used to create the scripts in this repository (download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Detailed instructions on how to download and install the latest version of Python are available [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/). Any version of Python 3 can run the scripts. You can also download Python by downloading the Python distribution, Anaconda. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and you will find instructions on how to download and install Anaconda for Windows [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

## How to Run the Python Scripts
See the section 'How to Run Python Scripts Using the Command-Line' [here](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/).


# Introduction to the Dataset

## What is the Iris Dataset

From Wikipedia:
> The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a [multivariate](#multivariate) data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*.
> The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. [1]

  <dd>Refers to the property of having multiple variables. Hence a *multivariate dataset* is a dataset with multiple variables, and *multivariate statistics* is the statistics of multivariate datasets.</dd>
