## How to Download and Run The Scripts
To download this repository, click on the green 'Clone or download' button near the top right of this page, and then select 'Download ZIP'. You will need to then unzip the downloaded file.
Python 3.7.4 was used to create the scripts in this repository (download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)), and any version of Python 3 can run the scripts.

## Files in this Repository
* a 'verifyIntegrityOfDataset' file to do just that
* a 'createDataFrame' file that creates a pandas dataframe based on the irisDataSet file
* a 'createHistograms' file that saves histograms for to the plots\histograms folder
* a 'createBoxplots' file that saves boxplots overlayed with swarm plots to the plots\boxplots folder
* a 'createScatterPlots' file that saves scatter plots to the plots\scatterPlots folder
* a 'createSummaryStatistics' file that saves summary statistics for each species to a csv file in the summaryStatistics folder
* an 'analysis' file which is the main application script and which imports and runs the functions in the other files
